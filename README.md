# Machine-Learning-Embeddings


While working with text data in machine learning one of the most important steps is embedding. Embedding can be of 3 basic different types: word embedding,character embedding and a mixture of both character and word embeddings. Here i have showcased 2 of the types mentioned and used word2vec for word and fasttext for character embedding.
